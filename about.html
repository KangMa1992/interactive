    <b>Bio</b>
    <p>Kang Ma (°1992, Xianyang, China) is an artist who works in a variety of media. By rejecting an objective truth and global cultural narratives, Ma tries to develop forms that do not follow logical criteria, but are based only on subjective associations and formal parallels, which incite the viewer to make new personal associations.</p>
    <p>His artworks are based on formal associations which open a unique poetic vein. Multilayered images arise in which the fragility and instability of our seemingly certain reality is questioned. By choosing mainly formal solutions, he creates with daily, recognizable elements, an unprecedented situation in which the viewer is confronted with the conditioning of his own perception and has to reconsider his biased position.</p>
    <p>His work urge us to renegotiate art as being part of a reactive or – at times – autistic medium, commenting on oppressing themes in our contemporary society. Kang Ma currently lives and works in New Haven.</p>
